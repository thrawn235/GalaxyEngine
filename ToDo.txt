To Do:

change file engine to take pointer ref instead of returning a buffer. it creates memory leaks
all engine parts should graceflly skip if they get a NULL pointer
the data engine should throw a warning when a block of data is not found
Predict is not working (it is working but janky. maybe pos needs to be float ? )
add scenes to engine
GameNode (Server/Client) should be able to add objects in a generic way without knowing all the types
test Delete and Purge Methods
DOS Network implementation
MemoryEngine
DLLs dont work in DOS! so no DLLs

ClientSideUpdate and UpdateServerIndependend is potentially slow and inefficient
