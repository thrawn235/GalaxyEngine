To Do:

Main Menu needs a "return to game" option
add scenes to engine
GameNode (Server/Client) should be able to add objects in a generic way without knowing all the types
InputEngine
test Delete and Purge Methods
DOS Network implementation
MemoryEngine
DLLs ?

ClientSideUpdate and UpdateServerIndependend is potentially slow and inefficient
