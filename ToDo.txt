To Do:

bug prevents drawing halfway off the screen

change file engine to take pointer ref instead of returning a buffer. it creates memory leaks
all engine parts should graceflly skip if they get a NULL pointer
the data engine should throw a warning when a block of data is not found
Predict is not working (it is working but janky. maybe pos needs to be float ? )
add scenes to engine
GameNode (Server/Client) should be able to add objects in a generic way without knowing all the types
test Delete and Purge Methods
DOS Network implementation
MemoryEngine
DLLs dont work in DOS! so no DLLs

need to find an efficient and elegang architecture for adaptive tile refresh
it either needs to be handled by the graphics engine or by a separate module before it

need to define what the client needs to know and what the server sends them

also a method for the server to efficently filter or rather prefilter objects when tests need to be done
dont need to check collision for stuff thats not even on the screen or near a player

need a way to ell the client to remove objects

ClientSideUpdate and UpdateServerIndependend is potentially slow and inefficient
