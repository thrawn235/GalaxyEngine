To Do:

LoadStatus / SendStatus should not be needed to be reimplemented for child classes
game ticks / predict doesnt work
Enemy has the wrong sender address on the server
MemoryEngine
make separate client and server setups possible
change all generic variable types (int) to fixed size ones like unit16_t
